    <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <!-- First paragraph explaining Time Complexity -->
    <p>Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the size of the input. efficient algorithms aim to minimize the time complexity to ensure quick execution even for large inputs.</p>

    <!-- Second paragraph explaining Space Complexity -->
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm needs to complete its task, relative to the size of the input. For instance, an algorithm with  Space Complexity  of O(n) requires a memory allocation that grows linearly with the input size, meaning it uses more memory as the input size increases.</p>
